### **Where can I find the link to our Slack channel?**

[Slack PYTH225](https://pyth225.slack.com)

### **How do I submit my homework?**

In Github, create a repository called `homework_submissions` by going to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). Make sure you **check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README"**.

Complete assignment in Colab. Then, go to File > Save a Copy to Github. In the "Repository" dropdown, choose `homework_submissions`. The file path should simply be the file name.

DM both **your instructor and IA** in the same message with your Github repo URL.

### **Where are all the practice problems?**

You can find a link to the practice problem source files at the top of the homepage. The link reads "PSETs". When you hover over it, a message appears saying, "A folder containing blank copies of all practice problem sets."

### **How can I see what the agenda for the next class is?**

On the homepage, you will find a list of lecture topics with dates. *This is a living list* based on how much material we cover in each class.

### **How does Colab work?**

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) exists as an extension of Google Drive. All the lectures and practice problems are in Colab notebooks. 

When you open them, make a copy for yourself. You can do this by going to File > Save a copy in Drive.... This will automatically create a folder called "Colaboratory" in your main Google Drive section. All copied files get automatically saved there.
