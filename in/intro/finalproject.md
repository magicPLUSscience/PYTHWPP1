# Final Project

**Prompt**: Build a simple webserver application with Flask. It must be available via [GitHub](https://github.com/wppai), complete with a [README](https://www.makeareadme.com/).

## Requirements

* **THREE** Flask API endpoints implemented, with the following requirements:
  * 1 **GET** endpoint, returns JSON
  * 1 **GET** endpoint, returns HTML
  * (your third endpoint can do/be anythig you want! HTML/JSON/something else, up to you!)
* One public API used, see [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) for examples/inspiration. Feel free to use any API that you want, not necessarily the ones provided in the Public APIs repo.
* HTML endpoint must use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Your project should live in a GitHub repo, with a clear [README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) (use the example in the provided link as a template)

## Deliverables

* You must have a Flask site running locally on your own machine
* You must upload your Github repo URL [here](https://airtable.com/shrgqwJm9uRyyIvqq)

## Presentations

You will have to present your project during the last week of the course (**Thursday June 25th**). To do so, you will start flask on your machine locally, share your screen with the rest of the class and then walk through your project, demonstrating your API endpoints in **two-four** minutes, max.

The reason for the aggressive timeline is that we have **50 people** in class so 4mins/person is **200 minutes**, or a little over 3 hours.

Additionally, folks are encouraged to sign up to **prerecord** their presentation **OR** present on **Tuesday June 23rd** during the first hour of class (second hour is for project help). This would be trememndously helpful as we can finish on time on Thursday and potentially help folks who are typically unable to join via video Zoom chats during class anyways.

Please sign up to volunteer to present earlier **[here](https://airtable.com/shrcM2PdCie8SqI0k)**
