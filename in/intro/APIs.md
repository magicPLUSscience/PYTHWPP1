# WWW: World Wide Web (...and python!)

In this lecture, we will be discussing how computers safely interact with one another and how we can leverage python to do the same.

## HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

This is basically a series of rules that are put in place to "communicate" over the internet. At the end of the day, this is all just text messages that are flowing back and forth from one computer to another.

## Requests and Responses

In HTTP parlance, we have the "request" and the 'response". A request is what a client makes to a remote machine (a "server"). The server can respond back with a variety of different messages.

## HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language

This is simply a language encoding that browsers understand. Based on the definition of these encodings, we can generate interactive web sites like the ones we have seen thus far.
