# Instructors

Hello, team! A few important links and ideas here - all public for the sake of transparency and more importantly: simplicity ðŸ˜€

## ðŸ‘‰ [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invyjyDY3FREI0V7s&inviteToken=77a8c4b974b0a587ee78402b150aeb7f13cc931295fd51a8f26736e641f06efb) ðŸ‘ˆ

This is the invitation to our WPP class base. This link is _only_ available to folks with **generalassemb.ly** email addresses. There will be several bases here that help us manage various parts of classroom tasks. If you haven't done so yet, **please sign up ASAP** 

## Squads

We will align ourselves into 4 **squads**. Each IA will be the **squad lead**. I ran a simple `n mod 4` to determine who ends up in which squad. Squads are named after pokemon to discourage the notion that they are somehow ranked (ie: hence no squad 1,2,3,4 or squad a.b.c.d):

* bulbasaur
* charmander
* squirtle
* pikachu

(After the class starter pokemon, ofc!).

### [Public Facing Squad Roster](https://airtable.com/shrX4qrqTERyfcgla)

In this base, I remove PII (emails) but still give you the ability to filter and group. However, you also have full readonly access to all the views (and emails) materialized here: [**Squad Base**](https://airtable.com/tblXKK1OayuV4KlqE/viwaZbR8uIukninHI?blocks=hide). (You can navigate the views with the dropdown on the top left).

### Managing Squad Members

IMO the best approach here is to create a DM space on Teams that includes you, your squad members, and me. This space can be used to manage and handle specific questions your squad members might have and to reach out to folks in a more intimate environment. Ideally, we want to encourage our friends to speak up in these DMs and to feel _comfortable_ to speak up.

Additionally, general homework feedback can be passed along here. 

## Attendance

Attendance is super important! Here is how attendance works:

1. Every lecture, I will share a verbal "token" with the class. These tokens are themed - for this course, I have chosen to use colors.
2. Students will fill out this **[link](https://airtable.com/shroqAUHnqBINgrtm)**, also shared on student facing class homepage, to "check in" to class
3. I materialize several views to help us more easily catalog and take attendance.

**[Full Base Access (read only)](https://airtable.com/tblgBnxolWeYulUTj/viwNJodJ60xe5ibnc?blocks=hide)** | **[Filterable "Public" View](https://airtable.com/shrrjCgiJ0eVQB4GM)**

## [Homework](https://airtable.com/tblIPolX9annjawIy/viwfXp1iUeGDU7Ncr)

This is the Airtable base necessary for you to manage homework submissions. If you click on the "Views" dropdown, you will see views the correspond to each homework submission + a view for "late" submissions.

## [Final Project Submissions](https://airtable.com/tblt20rulKIkCDfQe/viw6rcBKe38C7fSvD?blocks=hid)

This is the Airtable base necessary for you to manage final project submissions. Note there are two tabs here - first tab manages proposals and the second tab links to proposals and manages submissions.
