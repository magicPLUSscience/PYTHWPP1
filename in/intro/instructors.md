Hello, team! A few important links and ideas here - all public for the sake of transparency and more importantly: simplicity ðŸ˜€

| Resource | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|
| [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invyjyDY3FREI0V7s&inviteToken=77a8c4b974b0a587ee78402b150aeb7f13cc931295fd51a8f26736e641f06efb)     | This is the invitation to our WPP class base. This link is _only_ available to folks with **generalassemb.ly** email addresses. There will be several bases here that help us manage various parts of classroom tasks. If you haven't done so yet, **please sign up ASAP**     |
| [Attendance](https://airtable.com/tblgBnxolWeYulUTj/viwNJodJ60xe5ibnc?blocks=hide)     | This is the Airtable base necessary for you to manage class attendance. If you click on the "Views" dropdown, you will see the class "token" and the number of people who checked in for the day. After you sign up with your GA email address, this link should "just work"     |
| [Homework Submission](https://airtable.com/tblIPolX9annjawIy/viwfXp1iUeGDU7Ncr)     | This is the Airtable base necessary for you to manage homework submissions. If you click on the "Views" dropdown, you will see views the correspond to each homework submission + a view for "late" submissions. |
