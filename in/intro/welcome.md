## Class Overview

**We are here to learn Python**.

This website is called: **[http://taq.website/wpp](http://taq.website/wpp)** -- please bookmark it! It will serve as your source of truth going forward.

### Website Walkthrough

Why don't we spend a few minutes walking through this website and the features it provided.

## Class Rituals

Here are some class rituals to be aware of.

### Squadz

There are a lot of us here. Like, a lot. As such, we are breaking into subgroups that I am calling "squads". 

**WHO**
You and ~11-12 of your classmates will be a part of a squad. Squads have dedicated **team leads**. This IA will be your **point of contact** for all matters attendance, homework, and office hours.

**WHAT**
Basically, by having squads, we as an instructional team can divide and conquer by more closely catering to your educational and administrative needs.

Your squad lead will maintain an overall pulse as to how you are doing and progressing in your class. I will check in with all the leads to better understand overall patterns and adjust accordingly.

**ROSTER**

Make sure you **remember your squad group name**. This will be required in all further attendance, homework and final project submissions. The following roster is also available on the class homepage:

### Attendance

At the start of every class, you will be asked to fill out a form to **check-in** to class. This form will require a **token** that will be communicated to you verbally via Zoom. This ensures that whoever checked in was at least present in the beginning of class.

You may find the link to attendance check in on the top bar "quick links" section. **Remember**, we also need your squad name, which is accessible on this page and the class homepage.

### Questions/Feedback

Feedback is a **key** part of this course. At the end of every lecture, we will ask you to fill out an **[exit ticket](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/FXGR8N3?Cohort_ID=[Cohort_ID_value])** (also available via the quick links section on class homepage).

Feedback and also questions are paramount to our success as a class and your success in learning to code. Please don't be shy! If you feel comfortable, pleaes ask your question on the teams channel (**your squad lead should be opening a DM chain** with you and the rest of your squadmates). Otherwise, please reach out to your squad leader directly for further assistance.

### PSETs/Practice

Practicing is the **ONLY** way to effectively learn to code. Full Stop.

As a result, I have _hundreds_ of practice problems available for you to try. Please find them [here](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/wpp_psets) -- they are also available in the quick links section of the class homepage.

In class assignments and homework will be assigned from this problem bank. If you need help with practice problems, please reach out to your squad lead! Questions that are particularly difficult I will address in class, based on the reports provided by the squad leads.

### Homework

There will be homework assigned _most_ weeks. This is a best effect scenario - you get back what you put in. No grades will be delivered but instead, you will receive feedback on select problems (bandwidth permitting).

Homework is linked on the class **homepage**, below the letures. You will submit homework via a form available in the quick links section of class homepage.

### Final Projects

More on this later! But, we are lucky in that we have a week break before final projects.

### Zoom

Please edit your zoom name to inclue your first name and if possible, profile picture.

You are encouraged to ask questions on Zoom chat or on Teams, your IA wil pick up the question and optionally ask me so that I can cover with the entire class or, if specific enough, just reply back to you with an answer.

Also, when we do in-class exercises, we will split into "breakout rooms" where you will be paired with folks 1-2 of your class mates. The instructional team will pop in and out of these rooms in order to ensure you are staying on track and any specific questions that you may have are answered. If you would like to flag our attention, please @-msg us on Teams!

## Tools

Primarily, we will be using **[REPL.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3)** and the **command line** to write and operate our code. For the first week, we will be working primarily in REPL.it to ensure folks who were not able to get python installed have a chance to do so before we dive in in earnest.

**Please look at and ensure you are able to complete the command line lesson in pre-work** by end of week!

We will not learn command line functionality all at once but instead pepper it in based on need throughout the course. For those interested, here are my [lecture slides](https://show.zohopublic.com/publish/ivvjw880a8176a10d44ecbc4638c07bc180db) for the command line lesson I deliver to my graduate class at Baruch.

### Github

Please make a (free) account on [github](https://github.com)

### Code Editor

You are welcome to use any code editor you like, I will be teaching from [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

### Browser

It is strongly recommended that you use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for this class.

## Pre-work

The idea with pre-work is that you have a solid base to start on. We will still review the main concepts over the next week and a half but ideally it will help cement the content and also give you a chance to ask questions if you have them.
